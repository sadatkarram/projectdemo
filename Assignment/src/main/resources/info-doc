Few guidelines to follow:

No new libraries are expected.
There are 4 unit tests provided that should pass all the time.
Your goal is to understand and improve/refactor the BookingApp.java code.
The final working submission should be uploaded on GitHub and pass us the repository link.
Code written allows for booking a Bus ticket or a Car ticket based on the type of ticket.
There are three steps that are applicable to any type of booking.
	Validate that all input fields are present.
	Book the actual ticket based on the type. (Logic to book a Car ticket can be different than booking a Bus ticket).
	On a successful booking, send an email to the traveler.
You will need to refactor and improve the code based on your experience of how the booking code is functioning.
